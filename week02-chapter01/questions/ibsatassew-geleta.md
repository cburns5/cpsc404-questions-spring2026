# Week 2 Question - Chapter 1: Making Inevitable Conflict Productive

## Question

In Chapter 1, the author describes the relationship between an employee and a manager as a "low-intensity, long-term conflict" driven by fundamentally different agendas—technical excellence versus financial/organizational constraints. If "constructive loyalty" requires us to prioritize the manager’s success to ensure our own, how do we prevent this loyalty from becoming "blind obedience" in scenarios where the manager's agenda (e.g., cutting costs by skipping testing) creates technical debt that violates our professional responsibility to the project’s health?

## Context (optional)

The chapter emphasizes that conflict is a "feature, not a bug." However, it also suggests that as professionals, we "advise" while managers "decide." I am interested in exploring the boundary where the "Constructive" part of loyalty must take precedence over the "Loyalty" part to protect the long-term viability of the work itself.
