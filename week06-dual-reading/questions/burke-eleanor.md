## Question
In the ProducingOSS chapter, the author has a section on praise and criticism, in which they discuss how praise should be used sparingly or it will lose meaning. I feel like I use praise as a default when working with others, but the majority of projects I've worked on were short term (e.g., a class, summer internship, etc). I also find it very hard to give criticism. Does this praise / criticism advice change with amount of time you work with someone? Is it okay to praise more heavily at the beginning of a working relationship?
