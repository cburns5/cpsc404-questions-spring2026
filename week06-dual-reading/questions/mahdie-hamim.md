**Author:** Hamim Mahdie

## Question

Chapter 4 of Help Your Boss Help You centers on consistently sending two messages to your manager: “I got this” and “I got your back.” Chapter 8 of Producing Open Source Software discusses influence, decision-making, and leadership without formal authority.

How do these two models of influence compare in environments with and without hierarchy? What aspects of open source influence translate well to traditional manager–employee relationships, and which break down when formal authority and performance evaluation are involved?
