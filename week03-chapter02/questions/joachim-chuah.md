# Week 3 – HYBHY Chapter 2: Giving Good-Enough Answers

**Author:** Joachim Chuah

## Question
You said that "A good-enough answer today is much, much better than a great answer next week." 
What is the actual purpose of giving "good enough" answers? Is it to be efficient? or to build a form of trust and reliability with your boss? In any case, which should be more important?

## Context
Often times when we work for someone, we worry that giving an incomplete answer could mislead them, yet staying silent delays their decisions. This raises the tension between being professionally accurate and organizational responsiveness.
