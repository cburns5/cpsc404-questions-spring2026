## Question

Does the "good enough" answer strategy become dangerous in an era of persistent, written communication (Slack, Teams, Email)?

## Context

The chapter emphasizes responsiveness over perfection, which works well in verbal, ephemeral conversations. However, in modern remote work environments, a "good-enough" answer written in a public channel creates a permanent digital record. If your speculation turns out to be wrong three months later, that text remains visible to everyone, potentially damaging your reputation as an exeprt unlike a verbal chat that is easily forgotten.
