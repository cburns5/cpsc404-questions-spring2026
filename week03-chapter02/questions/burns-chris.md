# Week 3 Question - Chapter 2: Giving Good Enough Answers

**Student:** Chris Burns
**Date:** February 4, 2026

## Question

In giving good enough answers, it says good enough answers “might even be wrong, and nobody wants to be wrong to their manager. But being able to quickly provide good-enough answers helps you and your career”. Even with this considered, in the business world, is there a situation in which a wrong answer might not be a good enough answer either? And even when you resort to outside sources but still can’t formulate a good enough answer confidently, is there something different that you should do, and could this affect your relationship with your manager, or how your managers views you at all?

## Context (optional)

Often times in school, students come across complex problems that are hard to give an answer to. Sometimes when they consult other resources to potentially assist in this problem, they may be left more confused and still with no answer. This can make it hard for them to figure out the best way to answer a question even when they don’t have a good idea about a correct answer or solution.
